Lately, I often have to get images, change their size and extension. So I made myself this little editor.

#### Features

- Multiple images download;
- Image upload: png, jpeg, bmp, gif;
- Changing the extension of an image;
- Choosing the size of output images;

##### TODO:

- Load images into buffer
- If there is more than one image, return images in .zip
- Maybe it will become a telegram bot?
